59,Cross Site Request Forgery,Elevation Of Privilege,Utente->Browser,High,Needs Investigation,"Cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) is a type of attack in which an attacker forces a user's browser to make a forged request to a vulnerable site by exploiting an existing trust relationship between the browser and the vulnerable web site.  In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting. The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL/TLS.

289,Data Flow Sniffing,Information Disclosure,Flask-&gt;DB,Medium,Mitigated,"Data flowing across Generic Data Flow may be sniffed by an attacker. Depending on what type of data an attacker can read, it may be used to attack other parts of the system or simply be a disclosure of information leading to compliance violations. Consider encrypting the data flow.",Dati cifrati a monte,SC-8 Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity|SC-13 Cryptographic Protection
288,Potential Data Repudiation by PostgreSQL Service,Repudiation,Flask-&gt;DB,Low,Mitigated,"PostgreSQL Service claims that it did not receive data from a source outside the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data.",Logging su PostgreSQL abilitato di default,AU-2 Audit Events|AU-3 Content of Audit Records|AU-12 Audit Generation
287,Potential Lack of Input Validation for PostgreSQL Service,Tampering,Flask-&gt;DB,Medium,Mitigated,Data flowing across Generic Data Flow may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to a denial of service attack against PostgreSQL Service or an elevation of privilege attack against PostgreSQL Service or an information disclosure by PostgreSQL Service. Failure to verify that input is as expected is a root cause of a very large number of exploitable issues. Consider all paths and the way they handle data.
